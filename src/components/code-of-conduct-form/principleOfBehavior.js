                    <p>
                        As the school has a duty of care to its students, the expectation and understanding
                        are that all staff will act in the best interests of the students and that the welfare and
                        safety of students will be of paramount concern. All interactions therefore, should be
                        transparent and meet the principles of the Code of Conduct.
                        <br></br> <br></br>
                        This Code of Conduct is intended to provide staff and community members with
                        guidance as to the expected behaviors of all staffs ,visitors, and volunteers engaged
                        by Online Darul Uloom.
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        Staffs are expected to behave in a manner that promotes the safeguarding role of the
                        school, in a manner that is in accordance with professional expectations and best
                        practices of the teaching profession. <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        Any staff member who is unsure about appropriate boundaries in a particular
                        circumstance or must act contrary to either specific or implied boundaries, must
                        consult as early as possible with the Principal to discuss the possible breaches. If a
                        breach inadvertently occurs the staff member must bring it to the attention of the
                        Principal immediately.
                        <br></br> <br></br>
                        Staffs are responsible for their own actions and should avoid any conduct which
                        might be misconstrued by a reasonable person as inappropriate. When considering
                        their actions, they should consider the following: <br></br>
                        (a) How might this interaction be perceived by others?<br></br>
                        (b) Am I treating this student differently to others?<br></br>
                        (c) Can I achieve the same outcome through a different interaction?<br></br>
                        (d) Would I do this or say this if a colleague were present?<br></br>
                        (e) Would I condone my conduct if I observed it in another adult?<br></br>
                        (f) What guidance would my employer give me in this situation?<br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        5. What happens if I breach the Staff Code of Conduct?<br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        As a school employee, you hold a position of trust and are accountable for your actions.<br></br>
                        All alleged breaches of the Staff Code of Conduct will be subject to scrutiny and if
                        substantiated,the affected staff may be warned, suspended, or have his or her employment terminated.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>

                        5.1 The consequences of inappropriate behavior and breaches of this Code
                        will depend on the nature of the breach. <br></br><br></br>
                        5.2 Employees are required to report all objectively observable behaviors
                        that are not permitted by the Code, other than those subjected to
                        mandatorily reporting obligations to the Principal or the chair of the
                        schoolâ€™s governing body. NB: If the prohibited behavior is by the
                        Principal then it should be reported to the Chair of the governing body.<br></br><br></br>
                        5.3 Factors the school may consider when deciding what action to take
                        may include: <br></br>
                        a) the seriousness of the breach;<br></br>
                        b) the likelihood of the breach occurring again;<br></br>
                        c) whether the employee has committed the breach more than once;<br></br>
                        d) the risk the breach poses to employees, students, or others; and
                        whether the breach would be serious enough to warrant formal
                        disciplinary action.<br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        5.4 Actions that may be taken by the school in respect of a breach of the
                         Code include management or remedial action, training, or disciplinary
                        action ranging from a warning to termination of employment. The
                        school reserves the right to determine in its entirety, the response to
                        any breach of this Code

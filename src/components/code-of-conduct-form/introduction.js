                        This Code of Conduct details the standards of behavior expected of all employees of
                        the school.

                    <p>
                        This Code does not attempt to provide a rigid, detailed, and exhaustive list of what to
                        do in every aspect of your work. Instead, it sets out general expectations of the
                        standards of behavior required and gives some examples of the types of behavior that
                        are or are not acceptable.
                    </p>

                    <br></br>

                    <p>
                        The Code places an obligation on all employees to take responsibility for their own
                        conduct and to work with colleagues cooperatively to achieve a consultative and
                        collaborative work place where children are safe, and people are happy and proud to
                         work.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In all situations, and in particular regard to managing students’ behavior, the school
                        explicitly forbids any form of abuse,including child abuse.
                    </p>

                        b) the child has less power than another person involved in the
                        behavior; or <br></br>
                        c) there is a significant disparity in the developmental function or maturity of the child

                        This Code of Conduct will not only help in making our school a safer environment for
                        children but will also reduce the risk that staff will be unjustly accused of
                        unprofessional or abusive conduct
                    </p>
                    <br></br>

                    <p>
                        Nothing in this Code should be taken to limit the circumstances in which the school
                        may take disciplinary action in respect of an employee.

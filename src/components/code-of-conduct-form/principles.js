                    are responsible for teaching, tutoring ,advising, assessing, or for whom you provide
                    pastoral,or welfare support raises serious questions of conflict of interest,trust,

                    and colleagues and may carry a serious reputational risk for the school.<br></br><br></br>
                    2.If you consider that a student is being overly familiar,seeking to establish a personal
                    relationship with you, or has developed a 'crush' on you, you should report your
                    concerns to the Principal as soon as possible so that a plan can be developedt o
                    manage the situation effectively and sensitively.<br></br><br></br>

                    4. You may,as part of your pastoral care role, engage in discussion with students. This
                    is entirely appropriate.However,you must be cautious about making personal
                    comments about a student or asking questions that probe your own or a student's
                    sexuality or relationships. You must not hold conversations with a student of an
                    intimately personal nature where you disclose information about yourself.<br></br><br></br>
                    5. You must not engage in tutoring or coaching students from the school outside the
                    stated school periods without the express permission of the principal.<br></br><br></br>
                    6. You must not invite students to join your personal electronic social networking site or
                    accept students’ invitations to join their social networking site.<br></br><br></br>

                    before accepting any gift from a student or a parent.<br></br><br></br>
